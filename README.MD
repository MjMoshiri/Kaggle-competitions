Welcome to my Kaggle Competition Codes repository! This repository contains code files, notebooks, and resources related to Kaggle competitions I participated in starting 14/07/2023.

# How to navigate this repository
each competition has its own folder. The folder name is the same as the competition name. Each competition folder contains the following files:
- `README.md`: a readme file that contains a brief description of the competition and the notebook files in the folder.
- `notebook.ipynb`: a jupyter notebook file that contains the code I used to solve the competition problem.
- 'train.csv': a csv file that contains the training data.
- 'test.csv': a csv file that contains the test data.
- 'submission_dataVersion_modelName.csv': a csv file that contains the submission data using the version of the data and the model name in the file name.
